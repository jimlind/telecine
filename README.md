Telecine
========

Python script that automates my 8mm telecine machine.

Based on a Python script from "wistof"
http://www.instructables.com/id/Mouse-as-door-alarm/step3/Setup-Python-script/

That script borrowed all the best stuff from "rmt"
https://github.com/rmt/pyinputevent

How I Use It
========

Install Ubuntu 12.10
Install guvcview
Install imagemagick
Install python

Plugin Camera and Mouse

sudo python capture.py

Control+c to stop the script
